# haskell_todo_list
very basic and bad haskell todo list. it compiles and works but is probably not the most efficient way to do this, however it works and i am happy!

### features
- reading and writing files
- adding and removing items from lists
- basic terminal usage (clearing the screen)
- mapping, i think i used a lambda function somewhere????
- and lots more fun stuff!!!!!!!!
