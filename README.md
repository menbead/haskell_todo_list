# haskell_todo_list
very basic haskell todo list. it compiles and works but is probably not the most efficient way to do this, however it works and i am happy!

### features
- reading and writing files
- adding and removing items from lists
- basic terminal usage (clearing the screen)
- mapping, i think i used a lambda function somewhere????
- ENUM for the importance
- and lots more fun stuff!!!!!!!!

### how to compile
1. in a terminal in the directory, run:
```ghc todoList.hs```
2. you can run the exe!

### how to compile (with icon!)
1. follow this guide: https://wiki.haskell.org/Setting_an_executable_icon
2. then run:
```ghc todoList.hs Icon.o```
